          <h3>About Us</h3>
          <p>The list of etudes in our database was originally compiled by Beth Blackerby, the creator of <a href="http://violinlab.com/" target="_blank">Violin Lab</a> and Dr. Laurie Scott, associate professor of Music and Human Learning at UT Austin. Beth and Laurie saw a need for a diverse list of frequently used etudes and created a spreadsheet. Beth's daughter and Laurie's violin student, Madalyn Marabella, built the spreadsheet into this online database.</p>
          <p>Our database contains about 100 etudes for beginning, intermediate, and advanced players. Users can search for etudes that can help them practice both left hand and right hand techniques.</p>

          <h3>Teachers, Students, Directors...</h3>
          <p class="top-obj">Violinists of all levels use etudes to polish their technical skills. Etudes are short passages of music that usually focus on one specific tequnique, such as trills, double stops, or string crossings. However, as many of you have probably noticed, etudes are sold in books for a single composer. Teachers wind up with shelves full of etude books, from which they might only assign a few exercises. We developed this site to give teachers a quick way to search for and download individual, public domain etudes. Don't know the name of the etude? No problem. You can filter by skill level and technique and browse the results from our database.</p>
